    "Impression": "Cinematography was good for 20% of the shots but then not very pleasing and felt so digital. The screenplay felt very poor actually, as it was a book punt in a movie without adaption like characters speak their intentions and feelings instead of acting. The acting is not very real in most parts, but the main character is fine we can say. I don‚Äôt like most gimbal moves as they are too robotic, I would have used more of a stedicam than a gimbal.",

    "Impression": "I felt the story‚Äôs elements were very minimalistic. This does not mean they are few but meaningful. The scene with the bear cosplay felt minimal but shocking, in a positive way. I like being shocked by movies; this means they move you in a fundamental way. The cinematography is very clean to be a movie from the 80s, even though I don‚Äôt really like clean looks, it still has its own look; Zeiss' Superspeed contribute to it, and the cool/warm contrast is often present (even though not much as in https://www.notion.so/Eyes-Wide-Shut-849cca11c45242c5afe3032e4a0710dd, but that is a different story.) Another thing I don‚Äôt like is the practice of lighting the subject with white light in some scenes where it shouldn‚Äôt be there, but it was 1980... And finally: long zoom shots, they are crazy; I love them.",
